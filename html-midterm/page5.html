    <h1>Changelog</h1>
    <h2>Page 1 Changes:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Added missing HTML head info, such as doctype and meta, so that the code was able to be read correctly by the browser.</li>
        <li>Swapped the h2 and h3 tags so they're in the right order for a decreasing font size as you scroll further down the page.</li>
        <li>Added missing slash in the closing p tag in paragraph 6 so that the code is interpreted correctly with the paragraph element ending there.</li>
        <li>Fixed an incorrect closing tag to italicize "cr√®me fraiche" in paragraph 7 so that the text was actually italicized.</li>
    </ul>
    &nbsp;
    <h2>Page 2 Changes:</h2>
    <ul>
