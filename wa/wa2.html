    <h4>Course Goals</h4>
    <p>My goals for this course are to learn and expand my coding skills while creating new things and doing fun projects.</p>
    <h4>About Me</h4>
    <p>I'm a junior majoring in Environmental Design and minoring in Creative Technology and Design. 
        Within my program I am focusing in urban planning and am graduating this Spring, a year early. I run the American Planning Association
        Student chapter at CU Boulder and am a part of the CU Freeskiing team and the Women's Ultimate B team. I like to read, write, draw, and watch F1.
        I have some past coding experience and a decent amount of design experience but I'm looking forward to expanding those skills.</p>
