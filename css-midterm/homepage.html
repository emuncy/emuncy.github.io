                Hi, my name is Ellie Muncy.
            </p> 
            
            <p>
            I'm studying in the Environmental Design program 
            at the University of Colorado Boulder. I'm currently 
            a junior but planning to graduate a year early with a 
            specialization in Urban Planning. I graduated high 
            school with an Associate’s of Arts through concurrent 
            enrollment and am also working towards a minor in 
            Creative Technology and Design while in college. 
            This past summer I studied abroad in Medellín, 
            Columbia as part of a study abroad program offered 
            by my university.
            </p>
    
            <p>
            I like to create in several forms and besides 
            my projects done during school, I also enjoy 
            oil pastel drawings, photography, and mixed media 
            projects. In my free time, I like to read and write. 
            While in school I'm president of the APAS club as 
            well as a member of the CU Boulder Freeskiing team 
            and the Women’s Ultimate B Team.
            </p>
