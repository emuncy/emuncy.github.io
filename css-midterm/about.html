        <h2>About the Designer</h2>
        &nbsp;
        <p>Ellie is studying in the Environmental Design program 
        at the University of Colorado Boulder. She is currently 
        a junior but planning to graduate a year early with a 
        specialization in Urban Planning. Ellie graduated high 
        school with an Associate’s of Arts through concurrent 
        enrollment and is also working towards a minor in 
        Creative Technology and Design while in college. 
        This past summer Ellie studied abroad in Medellín, 
        Columbia as part of a study abroad program offered 
        by her school.</p>

        <p>Ellie likes to create in several forms and besides 
        her projects done during school, she also enjoys 
        oil pastel drawings, photography, and mixed media 
        projects. In her free time, Ellie likes to read and write. 
        While in school Ellie is president of the APAS club as 
        well as a member of the CU Boulder Freeskiing team 
        and the Women’s Ultimate B Team.</p>
